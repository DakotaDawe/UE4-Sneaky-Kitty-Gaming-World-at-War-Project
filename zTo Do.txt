Tim Maness: Hope this doesn't offend you or step on your toes, Sneaky Kitty....
But I have some quick "enhancements" that could be added here...
If you Collapse the "On chat Received" to a function, then you can reuse it for the 
"On Host Chat Received" Event, and by adding the "Scroll to end" node to the last bit, 
when a new message comes in it will automatically scroll to the bottom of the chat window scroll box.
Also, on your text committed you can add a "Set Text" node to the input message and leave it blank, 
which should clear the text on enter.
